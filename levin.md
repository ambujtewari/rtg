## Keith Levin

Keith's research focuses on the statistical analysis of network data. Networks arise in many areas of the sciences,
especially in biology and social science, but statistical tools for working with networks are still in their infancy.
Keith is particularly interested in applications of network models to neuroscience and speech processing. His most recent
projects have focused on multiple-graph analysis and developing bootstrap techniques for network models.
