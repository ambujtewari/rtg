## Gregory Hunt

Hunt's work focuses on methods for the analysis of high-dimensional scientific data, especially data from high-throughput
biological experiments. Currently, he is developing methods that aid analysis of genomic, epigenomic, and proteomic data.
In particular he has been working on projects to:

1. recover cell type proportions from high-throughput genomic data, and
2. estimate the correct transformation to retrieve low-rank approximations of data.
